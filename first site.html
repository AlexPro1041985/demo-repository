        <p class="red">There was Eru, the One, who in Arda is called Ilúvatar;
            and he made first the Ainur, the Holy Ones, that were the offspring
            of his thought, and they were  with him before aught else was made.
            And he spoke to them, propounding to  them themes of music; and they
            sang before him, and he was glad. But for a long  while they sang only
            each alone, or but few together, while the rest hearkened; for  each
            comprehended only that part of me mind of Ilúvatar from which he came,
            and in the understanding of their brethren they grew but slowly. Yet ever
            as they  listened they came to deeper understanding, and increased in
            unison and  harmony.</p>
